The following attributes are in the dataset:

  1.  Sequence Name: Accession number for the SWISS-PROT database
  2.  mcg: McGeoch's method for signal sequence recognition.
  3.  gvh: von Heijne's method for signal sequence recognition.
  4.  alm: Score of the ALOM membrane spanning region prediction program.
  5.  mit: Score of discriminant analysis of the amino acid content of
	   the N-terminal region (20 residues long) of mitochondrial and 
           non-mitochondrial proteins.
  6.  erl: Presence of "HDEL" substring (thought to act as a signal for
	   retention in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen). Binary attribute.
  7.  pox: Peroxisomal targeting signal in the C-terminus.
  8.  vac: Score of discriminant analysis of the amino acid content of
           vacuolar and extracellular proteins.
  9.  nuc: Score of discriminant analysis of nuclear localization signals
	   of nuclear and non-nuclear proteins.
